    <h1>Week 3: Relational Database Design and CRUD Operations</h1>
    <p>
      This week, we delved into relational database design, covering ER diagrams and normalization. We learned how to connect Go to PostgreSQL and perform database migrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key topics included:
      <ul>
        <li>Performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Homework included integrating CRUD functionality into the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the key topics, we also explored the following concepts in more detail:
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding the principles of database normalization and its importance in reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity</li>
        <li>Designing and creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to model the database schema</li>
        <li>Implementing database migrations using tools like `golang-migrate` to manage schema changes</li>
        <li>Connecting Go applications to PostgreSQL using the `pgx` library</li>
        <li>Writing SQL queries to perform CRUD operations and understanding the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases</li>
        <li>Optimizing database performance through indexing and query optimization techniques</li>
        <li>Implementing transactions in Go to ensure data consistency and integrity</li>
        <li>Testing database interactions using mock databases and the `sqlmock` library</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the week, we had a solid understanding of relational database design and how to integrate CRUD functionality into our Go applications. We were well-prepared to tackle more advanced topics in the coming weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ER diagrams, or Entity-Relationship diagrams, are a visual representation of the database schema. They help in understanding the relationships between different entities in the database. Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing the data into different tables and defining relationships between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Database migrations are a way to manage changes to the database schema over time. They allow us to apply incremental changes to the database schema, ensuring that the database remains consistent with the application's code. Tools like `golang-migrate` help in managing these migrations by providing a way to define and apply them programmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connecting Go applications to PostgreSQL involves using libraries like `pgx` to interact with the database. We can write SQL queries to perform CRUD operations, which are the basic operations for managing data in the database. These operations include creating new records, reading existing records, updating existing records, and deleting records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optimizing database performance is crucial for ensuring that the application runs efficiently. This can be achieved through indexing, which helps in speeding up the retrieval of data, and query optimization techniques, which help in improving the performance of SQL queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transactions in Go are used to ensure data consistency and integrity. They allow us to group multiple operations into a single unit of work, ensuring that either all the operations are completed successfully, or none of them are applied. This helps in maintaining the consistency of the data in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testing database interactions is an important aspect of ensuring that the application works as expected. We can use mock databases and libraries like `sqlmock` to simulate database interactions and test the application's code without actually interacting with the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a student taking this course, I found the content of Week 3 to be incredibly valuable. The hands-on experience of designing relational databases and performing CRUD operations helped me solidify my understanding of database concepts. The detailed exploration of ER diagrams, normalization, and database migrations provided me with the knowledge and skills needed to build efficient and scalable database systems. The homework assignments and quizzes reinforced the concepts learned in class and allowed me to apply them in practical scenarios. Overall, Week 3 was a challenging yet rewarding experience that laid a strong foundation for the rest of the course.
