<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Week 4: Template Engines and Basic Authentication</h1>

<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    This week, we covered template engines, focusing on passing data to templates and template logic and control flow.
    Basic authentication was also covered.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Key topics included:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Integrating templates into the application for homework</li>
    <li>A quiz on database modeling and templates</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    In addition to the key topics, we also explored the following concepts in more detail:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Understanding the principles of template engines and their role in rendering dynamic content</li>
    <li>Implementing template logic and control flow using Go's `html/template` package</li>

</ul>

<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    By the end of the week, we had a solid understanding of template engines and basic authentication, and we were
    well-prepared to tackle more advanced topics in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Template engines are tools that help in rendering dynamic content by combining templates with data. They allow us to
    separate the presentation logic from the business logic, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
    In Go, we use the `html/template` package to work with templates.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Template logic and control flow are essential for rendering dynamic content. We can use conditional statements,
    loops, and functions within templates to control the rendering process. This allows us to create complex and dynamic
    web pages with ease.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Passing data from the server to templates is a crucial aspect of working with template engines. We can pass data in
    the form of structs, maps, or other data structures, and render it dynamically within the templates. This helps in
    creating personalized and data-driven web pages.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Creating reusable template components and partials is a best practice for improving code maintainability. We can
    create small, reusable pieces of templates and include them in other templates as needed. This helps in reducing
    code duplication and makes it easier to manage the templates.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Basic authentication is a method of securing web applications by requiring users to provide a username and password
    to access certain resources. We can implement basic authentication using sessions and cookies. Sessions help in
    maintaining the user's authentication state, while cookies are used to store session information on the client's
    browser.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Securing user passwords is an important aspect of authentication. We can use hashing algorithms like bcrypt to
    securely store user passwords in the database. Hashing ensures that even if the database is compromised, the
    passwords remain secure.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Handling user registration, login, and logout functionality is essential for any web application that requires
    authentication. We can create forms for user registration and login, and implement the necessary logic to handle
    these actions. Logout functionality helps in ending the user's session and ensuring that they are logged out of the
    application.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Testing template rendering and authentication logic is crucial for ensuring that the application works as expected.
    We can use Go's testing framework to write tests for template rendering and authentication logic. This helps in
    identifying and fixing issues early in the development process.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    As a student taking this course, I found the content of Week 4 to be incredibly valuable. The hands-on experience of
    working with template engines and implementing basic authentication helped me solidify my understanding of these
    concepts. The detailed exploration of template logic, control flow, and data passing provided me with the knowledge
    and skills needed to build dynamic and secure web applications. The homework assignments and quizzes reinforced the
    concepts learned in class and allowed me to apply them in practical scenarios. Overall, Week 4 was a challenging yet
    rewarding experience that laid a strong foundation for the rest of the course.
